<h2>Power Outages in North California</h2>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>Since 2007 California has a fire season <a href="https://laist.com/2019/10/28/california-fires-explained-why-they-are-getting-worse.php">[1]</a>.
    PG&E, power provider to most of California, was found responsible for more than 80% of the state's major wildfires. Thus fire preventing power shutoffs were happening this year. According to PG&E chief executive Bill Johnson the outages might continue for a decade <a href="https://laist.com/2019/10/28/california-fires-explained-why-they-are-getting-worse.php">[2]</a>.
    There are 5.4 million PG&E electric customers. During the blackouts 
    PG&E's website crashed several times, call center were overloaded <a href="https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2019/10/10/power-outage-pge-ceo-apologizes-customers-not-prepared/">[3]</a>. Nor PG&E nor people were prepared for such massive 
    shutoffs. 
.</p>
<p>The goal of my project is to help people and organizations to prepare for the next fire season.</p>
    
    
<h3>The Data</h3>
    <p> Simon Willison has been scraping data from PG&E's website last few months. The data lives in his <a href="https://github.com/simonw/pge-outages/commits/master">github repository</a>.
    Each snapshot contains: Location, Number of Customers, Cause, Time Stamp…

<h3>Findings</h3>
<ul>
    <li>3.7 million (out of 5.4 million) customers were affected</li>
    <li>The longest shutoff lasted 383 hours (almost 16 days)</li>
    <li>Average fire outage lasts 4 times longer than “regular” outage, 43.8 vs 10.7 hours</li>
    <li>More than half (55%) fire outages started during the night, 
between 10pm and 7am.</li>
</ul>
   
<h3>October 2019</h3>
    <p>For each snapshot I calculated the sum of all the affected customers.</p>

<h3>Directions to explore</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Some (how many?) outages start labeled as "Unknown - PG&E will be assessing the cause", then change to "PG&E is investigating the cause of your outage", and later it might become "To protect public safety, power in your area has been turned off due to extreme weather conditions with high fire danger. Power will be restored as soon as it is safe to do so" (fire outage). Should we trace each outage (some of them appeared in more than a 1000 snapshots).
